TODO:

kcal and protein switch on tap 

correct amount of protein and kcal in list items <CHECK>


bucket title date: add kcal and protein in text


food item entry:
- computed property gram equivalent

solve problem with everloading items

header for dashboard

translation of amount:
- split maybe in head and tail, e.g. 1 apple (medium)
- make oneMedium -> ""
- fix rounding of even numbers, e.g. 4.0000 should be just 4


think about dynamic amountwidth in food item list item, so that aligned for each bucket
